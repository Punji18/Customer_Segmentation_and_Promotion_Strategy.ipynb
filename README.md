# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation & Marketing Strategy

This project combines data science and product thinking to drive actionable marketing insights from customer data using **Python** and **Power BI**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

We used real-world-style customer data to:

- Segment customers using **K-Means Clustering**
- Predict total spend using **Linear Regression** & **Random Forest**
- Build a marketing strategy based on data-backed personas
- Visualize insights via an interactive **Power BI dashboard**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Power BI** (free version)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized customer data
- Features included: Age, Income, Product Category, Total Spend, etc.

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Applied **K-Means** to group customers into 5 clusters
- Created personas with pain points, traits, and campaign suggestions

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Built **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** models
- Target: Predict `Total_Amount_Spent`
- Evaluated with **R² score** and **RMSE**

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Visuals: Cluster distribution, Spend by Category, Age distribution
- Insights: Ideal campaign per persona, high-value customer traits
